# 1.Intro #

-This app is like a news aggregator, where you can find four websites to watch their news...  
-The main idea of this app is for daily knowledge, to see what is happening in the entire world, in tech and politics domains.   
***

# 2.Description #

-Here you can learn few tips about XML WebView, what can do with this widget, how to incorporate some transitions and other animations;  
-This app is very compact, small and can give you some concepts to develop apps for Android, how to make the architecture of an app, and how to give it a modern design (including those animations/transitions).   
***

# 3.Conclusion #

-For me, this app is useful, for other I hope it will be too, not just for it's purpose (to stay tuned watching the news), but also with the Android app development cycle, architecture and UI/UX.
